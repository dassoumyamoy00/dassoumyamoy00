## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Soumyamoy Das

### About Me
I am an innovative and passionate software developer having almost 2 years of industry experience in developing robust applications. I am interested in problem solving, open-source projects and to explore new domains. Hence, most of the time I'm busy in learning some new tech stuff beyond my domain and job prospect ðŸ˜„. 
<br><br>
I am avid listener of music of various genres and languages. So after a tedious coding session and design discussion, it's the music that helps me rejuveneate the potential back again to explore something new! For the me-time, it's always getting glued to some documentaries! And yes, I am also a reader of non-fiction literature and articles, and also love to paint my imaginations.
